Allow for voltage ranges on individual daq channels
Implement namedtuple for piezos?

Fix preamp timeout error
Fix attocube communication error

Allow for instruments = None to make an object with the same plotting, data saving/loading capabilities but without having to use the same instruments in two places


Save data while measurement in progress - test with mod2D?

When reading files that are open for writing, copy the file and load temp copy


Find location of Nowack_Lab module and figure out paths from there

directory_of_this_module = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))




Once have conversion factors, have touchdown "hone in" on center of piezo range better. Right now attocubes will miss.

	-If change direction multiple times, reduce attocube number of steps

Build in all conversion factors

Touchdown with floating table


Figure out matplotlib notebook


In preamp driver (and others), only set values if they change

test daq sweep accel - kind of pointless right now, need to fix.

reset squid before each scan
 - auto reset? use subprocess? 
	open = subprocess.Popen([‘python’, ‘somefile.py’]) #starts background process
	popen.kill() # when done

initialize squidarray object without zeroing PFL - impossible? No way of reading values

walkthrough function tune and lock squid/array

Array class that deals with pci, pfl.
	
-Auto tune function would be cool


Scanning procedure:
	
add squid relock
	
Figure out rates
	
Look at sweep rate as a function of number of points
	
Fine over one direction, coarse over other

	Change scan direction (arbitrary scan angle???)
		
Need to try swap as-is and go from there. 
		
Would be good to get x/y straight when swapped vs not
		
Also would be good to “un-rotate” a scan to see which direction need to move with attocubes
